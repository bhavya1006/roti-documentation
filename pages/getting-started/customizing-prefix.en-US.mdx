## What is prefix ?

A Discord bot prefix is a character or set of characters that are used to distinguish commands for a bot from normal chat messages. When a user wants to issue a command to a bot, they type the prefix followed by the command. For example, if the prefix is `!`, a user might type `!help` to get a list of available commands from the bot.

The use of a prefix helps to avoid confusion between normal chat messages and bot commands, and ensures that the bot only responds to messages that are intended as commands.
