## <span className="txp">Customization & Setup</span>

### <span className="yfq">What is JSON and how to use it in embeds ?</span>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store information in a simple, organized format that's easy for computers (and humans!) to read.  Think of it like a recipe with ingredients and instructions. In Discord embeds, you use JSON to define things like:

- Titles and Descriptions
- Colors
- Images and thumbnails
- Author details
- Fields
- Footer

and more ...

If you want to create really fancy embeds, you'll need to get comfortable with JSON. For a deeper dive into how to use it, take a look at our detailed docs page [here](/basic-configuration/embeds#json-for-fine-tuning).

### <span className="yfq">How to set up a verification system in R.O.T.I ?</span>

R.O.T.I doesn't have a built-in verification system, but you can easily achieve a similar effect using self-roles. This helps keep your server safer from bots and spam accounts. Here's how:

<Steps>
#### Step 1 - Create a "Verified" role

Create a new role and give this role access to all the channels in your server that you want verified members to see. Also, remove access from your "verification" channel for this role. This hides the verification channel once the role is assigned.

#### Step 2 - Set up a self-role menu

You can use either buttons (`/buttonrole`) or a dropdown menu (`/selectrole`) to enable users to choose the "Verified" role.

#### Step 3 - Make the "Verified" role un-removable

When creating the self-role, make sure to select the **Verify** type to prevent users from taking the role off themselves once they have it.
</Steps>

Now, when a new user joins, they'll only see the "verification" channel. Once they assign themselves the `Verified` role, they'll gain access to the rest of your server and the verification channel will disappear from their view!

For more detailed instructions on setting up self-roles, check out our docs [here](/basic-configuration/self-roles).
