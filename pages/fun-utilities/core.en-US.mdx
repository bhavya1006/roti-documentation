## Help Command

The `/help` command is your key to unlocking the full potential of R.O.T.I. It serves as both a quick reference guide and a detailed manual. Use `/help` on its own to get a list of all the command categories R.O.T.I has to offer.

If you need more specifics,  try `/help [command]` to get step-by-step instructions on a particular command, including what it does, the exact format to use it, and any special permissions it might require.

```
