## Editing a Giveaway

Modify the details of an ongoing giveaway effortlessly with R.O.T.I's `/giveaway edit` command. Simply provide the message ID, and then adjust the winner count, update the prize, or extend the duration by adding more time. This command gives you the flexibility to refine and adapt your giveaway as needed, ensuring a seamless and personalized experience for both you and your community. Whether you're fine-tuning the specifics or making last-minute adjustments, this command makes the process simple and efficient.

### Use the Command

Type `/giveaway edit [Message ID]` and replace [Message ID] with the actual ID you copied.

- Duration: Add more time to the giveaway if it's still running.
</Steps>
