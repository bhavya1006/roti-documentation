## AFK Commands

Manage your Away From Keyboard (**AFK**) status with ease! These commands allow you to signal when you're stepping away, include optional reasons for your absence, and provide commands (**for those with permissions**) to manage AFK statuses across the server. `/afk` command requires one of the following subcommands:

<Steps>

### Set AFK Status

Let others know you're stepping away from the keyboard by setting your status as **AFK**. Include an optional reason to explain your absence (e.g., lunch break, going to sleep).

```bash filename="Usage"
/afk set [reason]
```
<Callout type="info">
Your AFK status will be automatically removed when you type anything, use a bot command, or send attachments. Please be aware that the AFK status will not be removed within 30 seconds of setting it.
</Callout>

### Remove AFK Status

This command removes the AFK status from yourself or another user (if you have the necessary permissions), meaning they will no longer be shown as `Away From Keyboard` to others.

```bash filename="Usage"
/afk clear [user]
```
### Reset AFK Reason

Admins or users with appropriate permissions can use this command to clear the AFK reason of themselves or other users. The user will still appear as AFK, but they won't have an away message displayed.

```bash filename="Usage"
/afk reset [user]
```
### List AFK Users

Get an overview of all users currently marked as AFK on the server, along with their away messages (if they have set one).

```bash filename="Usage"
/afk list
```

</Steps>

## Announce

Broadcast important messages with a visually distinct and customizable announcement. Attract attention with optional mentions, and create eye-catching layouts using the embed creation panel.

```bash filename="Usage"
/announce [channel] [ping] [here]
```
Options:

- `channel`: The channel where you want to send the announcement.
- `ping`: The role to mention (@everyone, @moderators, etc.).
- `here`: Pings everyone who is online.

## Reminder

This command sets a personal reminder that the bot will deliver to you as a direct message at a specified time. Perfect for remembering tasks, appointments, deadlines, or anything else you don't want to miss.

```bash filename="Usage"
/remindme [time] [reason]
```
Options:

`[time]`: How long until you want to be reminded. Examples:
- 5m (5 minutes)
- 2h (2 hours)
- 1d (1 day)
- 30s (30 seconds)

`[reason]`: What you want to be reminded about. Keep it clear and concise for easy recall.

Example:

```bash
/remindme [1h] [Submit project proposal]
```
How Reminders Work:

- The bot will send you a direct message when your specified time is up.
- Reminders are private â€“ only you will see them.

**They offer customizable elements like:**

- Titles
- Descriptions
- Colors
- Images (thumbnails and main images)
- Fields (for structured info like name/value pairs)
- Footers
- Timestamps
