**Key Concepts & Terminology**

- `User`: A member of your server.
- `Channel`: A designated space for text or voice communication within your server.
- `Reason`: An explanation for a moderation action (ban, warn, etc.).
- `Duration`: The length of time a punishment (timeout, ban) will last.
- `Delete Message Days`: An option for bans that specifies how many days of a user's message history to delete.

## Core Commands

<Steps>

### Banning a User

Permanently bans a user from your Discord server. This action cannot be reversed unless manually unbanned by a moderator.

```bash filename="Usage"
/ban [user] [delete_message_days] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Ban Command](./img/ban.png)

### Kicking a User

Removes a user from the server. Unlike banning, they can rejoin if they have an invite link.

```bash filename="Usage"
/kick [user] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Kick Command](./img/kick.png)

### Timeout

Restricts a user from participating in voice channels and chatting in text channels for a specified duration. It serves as a typical disciplinary measure for addressing disruptive behavior in both voice and text chat interactions.

```bash filename="Usage"
/timeout [user] [duration] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Timeout Command](./img/timeout.png)

### Warning a User

Issues a formal warning to a user. Warnings are tracked as part of their moderation history.

```bash filename="Usage"
/warn [user] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Warn Command](./img/warn.png)

![Warn Message](./img/warn-msg.png)

### Voice Move

Efficiently moves all members from one voice channel to another voice channel on your Discord server.

```bash filename="Usage"
/voicemove [from] [to]
```
**Options:**

- `[from]`: The current voice channel where users are located.
- `[to]`: The voice channel where you want to move the users.

**Example:**

![Voicemove Command](./img/voicemove.png)

### Revoke Ban

Reverses a ban on a user, allowing them to rejoin the server.

```bash filename="Usage"
/unban [user] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Unban Command](./img/unban.png)

### Remove Timeout

Removes an active timeout from a user, allowing them to participate in voice & text chat again.

```bash filename="Usage"
/removetimeout [user]
```
**Example:**

![Remove Timeout Command](./img/rm-timeout.png)

### Deleting Messages

The `/purge` command allows you to bulk delete messages in a channel based on specified criteria, helping to maintain a clean and organized chat environment.

```bash filename="Usage"
/purge [amount] [options]
```
**Options:**

These options can be applied to delete messages from specific users or those containing specific words, and more.

- `channel`: Specifies the channel from which messages should be deleted.
- `user`: Deletes messages only from a specific user.
- `link`: Deletes messages containing URLs or links.
- `invite`: Deletes messages containing invite links.
- `contain`: Deletes messages containing specific text.
- `bot`: Deletes only messages sent by bots.
- `human`: Deletes only messages sent by humans.
- `regex`: The regex filter allows you to delete messages based on a provided regular expression (regex). Regular expressions are powerful patterns that describe text. The regex filter is case-sensitive and supports fuzzy search.

If no filters are provided, the command will purge the specified amount of messages without any additional conditions.

**Example:**

![Purge Command](./img/purge.png)

</Steps>

## Advanced Moderation

<Steps>

### Mass Banning

Bans multiple users at once from a server.

```bash filename="Usage"
/massban [users] [reason] [delete_message_days]
```
**Example:**

![Mass Ban Command](./img/mass-ban.png)

<Callout type="error" emoji="💀">
It's best to verify the list of users carefully before executing this command.
</Callout>

### Soft Ban

Kicks a user from the server and then immediately unbans them. This is often used to clear their recent message history. By default, it deletes user messages from the last 7 days.

```bash filename="Usage"
/softban [user] [delete_message_days] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Soft Ban Command](./img/soft-ban.png)

### Temporary Ban

Bans a user for a specified amount of time. After the duration expires, the ban is lifted automatically.

```bash filename="Usage"
/tempban [user] [duration] [delete_message_days] [reason]
```
**Example:**

![Temp Ban Command](./img/temp-ban.png)

</Steps>

## Moderation Management

<Steps>
### Viewing Moderation Logs

Displays a history of moderation actions taken against that user (bans, kicks, warnings, etc.).

```bash filename="Usage"
/modlogs [user]
```
![Modlogs Command](./img/modlogs.png)

### Retrieving Case Information

Retrieves specific details about a past moderation action taken against a user. The log ID can be found using the `/modlogs` command.

```bash filename="Usage"
/case [user] [log_id]
```
![Case Command](./img/case.png)

### Updating Moderation Reasons

Updates the reason for a past moderation action. Use the log ID provided from the `/modlogs` command.

```bash filename="Usage"
/reason [user] [log_id] [reason]
```
![Reason Command](./img/reason.png)

![Reason Message](./img/reason-msg.png)

### Adjusting Punishment Durations

Adjusts the length of an existing ban or timeout. Use this if you need to shorten or lengthen a temporary punishment.

```bash filename="Usage"
/duration [user] [duration]
```
![Duration Command](./img/duration.png)

![Duration Message](./img/duration-msg.png)

</Steps>

## Managing Warnings

<Steps>
### Checking Warnings

Displays a list of all warnings a user has received.

```bash filename="Usage"
/warnings [user]
```
![Warnings Command](./img/warnings.png)

### Clearing Warnings

```bash filename="Usage"
/clearwarns [user]
```
**Example:**

![Clear Warns Command](./img/clear-warns.png)

### Deleting Warnings

Removes a specific warning from a user's record (use the warning ID obtained from `/warnings`).

```bash filename="Usage"
/delwarn [user] [warning_id]
```
**Example:**

![Delete Warn Command](./img/del-warn.png)
</Steps>

## Fun and Informative

### Sending Messages as Others

Sends a message that appears to be from another user. Use responsibly, as it can be misused to impersonate others.

```bash filename="Usage"
/say [text] [channel] [user]
```
**Example:**

![Say Command](./img/say.png)

![Say Message Command](./img/say-msg.png)

## Permission Management

By using the `/permission` command, you can enable or disable message commands (which are executed using a prefix) only. If you want to enable or disable slash commands, refer to the guide [here](/faq#how-to-enable-or-disable-a-command-in-roti-).

<Steps>
### Enabling Commands in Channels

Allows the specified command to be used in a particular channel.

```bash filename="Usage"
/permission enable [command] [channel]
```

### Disabling Commands in Channels

Prevents a command from being used in a particular channel.
