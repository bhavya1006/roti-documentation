## Temporary Roles

Temporary roles offer a way to grant roles to users for a limited duration. Temporary roles are perfect for situations where you want to grant access, highlight a user, or provide a special status for a set period of time.

```bash filename="Usage"
/temprole [target] [role] [duration]
```
Options:

- `[target]`: The user you want to give the temporary role to.
- `[role]`: The role you want to assign temporarily.
- `[duration]`: How long the role should last.

The assigned role will be automatically removed from the user once the specified duration has passed.

## Creating a New Role

Create a brand-new role to organize your server. Carefully choose a name, color, and optional icon to reflect the role's purpose or status. You can even determine where it appears in your server's role hierarchy.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role create [name] [color] [icon] [position]
```
Options:

- `[name]`: The name of your role.
- `[color]`: Choose a color to visually distinguish the role.
- `[icon]`: Include an emoji or image associated with the role.
- `[position]`: Determine where the role appears in the list.

## Deleting an Existing Role

If a role is no longer needed or becomes outdated, remove it from your server entirely. This helps keep your role list organized and prevents confusion for members.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role delete [role] [reason]
```
Options:

- `[role]`: The role you want to delete.
- `[reason]`: Provide an explanation for the removal.

## Updating User Roles

Grant a specific role to a user to give them access to certain channels, abilities, or recognition within your server. Additionally, you can remove a role to adjust their level of participation.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role update [target] [role]
```
Options:

- `[target]`: The user whose role you want to modify.
- `[role]`: The role you want to add or remove from the user.

## Getting Role Information

The `/role info` command provides a comprehensive breakdown of a specific role on your server. This is helpful for understanding the role's function within your community.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role info [role]
```
Options:

- `[role]`: The role you want information on.

Simply specify the role you're interested in, and you'll receive the following details

- `Name`: The name of the role.
- `ID`: The unique identifier for the role.
- `Members`: The number of server members who currently have this role.
- `Position`: Where the role appears in the server's role hierarchy (higher positions are closer on the list).
- `Mentionable`: Whether the role can be mentioned (using @role) to notify its members.
- `Hoisted`: If the role is displayed separately in the members list.
- `Managed`: Whether the role is created or managed by an integration or bot.
- `Color`: The visual color associated with the role.
- `Creation Date`: When the role was created.
- `Permissions`: A list of specific permissions granted by this role.

## Viewing Role Members

See a complete list of everyone on your server who has been assigned a particular role. This can be useful for checking participation, managing events, or understanding how a role is being used.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role members [role] [attachment]
```
Options:

- `[role]`: The role to check.
- `[attachment]`: Creates a downloadable file with the member list.

## Listing All Roles

View a full list of all roles that exist on your server. This provides a snapshot of how roles are being used to structure your community.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role list [filter]
```
Options:

- `[filter]`: Enter name to narrow down the list to roles containing that name.

![Role List Command](./img/role-list.png)

## Mass Role Removal

⚠️ Use with caution! This command removes a designated role from every single user on your server. This might be necessary for restructuring, or if a role becomes obsolete.

```bash filename="Usage"
/role removeall [role]
```
Options:

- `[role]`: The role you want to remove from everyone.
