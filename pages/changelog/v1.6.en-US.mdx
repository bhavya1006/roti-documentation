### [Ticket Statistics](/server-management/ticket-system#ticket-statistics)

Added a new `/ticket stats` command, providing comprehensive ticket statistics for your server.

### [Opened Ticket Count](/server-management/ticket-system#show-opened-stats)

Added a new feature called Opened Ticket Count. This feature updates the opened tickets count in the Ticket Panel button.

### [Command Permissions](/user-management/moderation#permission-management)

Using the `/permission` command, you can now easily enable or disable message commands for the entire server at once, eliminating the need to manage them individually for each channel.
