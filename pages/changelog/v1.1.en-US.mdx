<Steps>

### [Suggestion System](/server-management/suggestion)

Implemented an ID (#1, #2) in the suggestion embed title for improved organization. Users are now required to utilize this ID for resolving suggestions instead of a message ID.

### [Embed](/basic-configuration/embeds#add-link-buttons)

The "Add Link Button" now accommodates any emoji from any server without the necessity for the emoji to originate from a server where the bot is present. Additionally, non-Nitro users can utilize emoji IDs to use emojis from another server.
