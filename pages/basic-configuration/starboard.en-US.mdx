## Introduction to Starboard

The Starboard System is designed to promote and appreciate exceptional messages in your server. It enables your members to react with a star emoji (‚≠ê) to express their admiration or recognition for a particular message. Once a message reaches a specified threshold of star reactions, it is displayed on the starboard, a dedicated channel that serves as a showcase for remarkable content.

## Set up Starboard System

The `/starboard set` command is used to configure the starboard channel and set the star threshold. This command requires the following arguments:

- **channel**: Specify the channel where the starboard messages will be displayed. This should be a dedicated channel exclusively for the starboard.

- **threshold**: Set the number of star reactions required for a message to appear on the starboard. This threshold determines the level of recognition for a message.

**Command Usage:**

```bash
/starboard set [channel] [threshold]
```

## Enable Starboard System

The `/starboard enable` command enables the Starboard System in your server. Once enabled, members will be able to start starring messages for recognition on the starboard.

**Command Usage:**

```bash
/starboard enable
```

## Disable Starboard System

The `/starboard disable` command disables the Starboard System in your server. When disabled, members will no longer be able to star messages, and the starboard functionality will be turned off.

/starboard disable
```

## Ignoring Specific Channels

The `/starboard ignore` command allows you to specify the channel that should be ignored by the Starboard System. Messages in this channel will not be eligible for the starboard.
