## Set up Meme channel

With the `/memechannel set` command, server admins can configure an automated meme channel. By default, memes will be sourced from the popular subreddit "r/memes". However, admins have the option to specify a different subreddit channel for memes. Additionally, admins can choose whether to enable NSFW in the meme channel.

**Example usage:**

This command will set the designated channel as the meme channel, enable NSFW, and source memes from the subreddit "dankmemes". If any of the optional arguments are omitted, the default settings will be applied.

## Removing Meme channel

Should you decide to discontinue the automated meme channel, simply use the `/memechannel remove` command. This will remove the existing meme channel setting, allowing you to make changes or choose a different approach to meme sharing in your server.
